## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing an existing mechanical assembly, accurately modeling all non-standard components, integrating standard parts from the SolidWorks Toolbox, and producing engineering-compliant technical drawings.

The final outcome is a fully constrained and functional assembly that includes a provided industrial actuator and selected standard components, modeled and documented according to engineering drawing standards.
